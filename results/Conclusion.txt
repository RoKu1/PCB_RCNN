Object detection is a challenging computer vision task that involves predicting both where the objects 
are in the image and what type of objects were detected. R-CNN algorithms have truly been a game-changer 
for object detection tasks. There has suddenly been a spike in recent years in the amount of computer 
vision applications being created, and R-CNN is at the heart of most of them.
In the above Project we have proposed a methodology for Fault detection in a printed circuit board.
The Model was designed and trained for 243 layers of a masked R-CNN and was trained using a GPU on 
google colab.The weights were saved in a HyPy file and were used to load the model afterwards
The performance of the model was evaluated using both the test set as refrence as well as the real 
life image of a printed circuit board that was captured using webcam. The local model was very 
successfull on the test set with accuracy of 98.7.
